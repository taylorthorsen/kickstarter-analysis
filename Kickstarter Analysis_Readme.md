# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The Purpose of this challenge was to get us comfortable working with excel and being able to digest large data sets. Through this kickstarter we have been able to visualize and analyze Louise's data to help her campaign be successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After forming an analysis based on launch dates from her campaign. I was able to target dates where she had the most successful outcomes. May and June are great times to launch theatre campaigns. We dound the most successful campaigns started in those months with 111 in May and 100 in June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After analyzing the data on outcomes based on the goals  of her campaigns, Louise would find success with majority of campaigns with a goal less than $5,000. Coming in at a close second, we see a good percentage of projects that were successful between $3,000 and $3,999. No campaigns with a goal between $4,000 and $4,500 were successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For the most part, I felt I had a pretty good grasp on the functions in excel. The main challenge I had was creating the line graph for Outcomes Based on Goals. At first I was trying to create it through a pivot chart, and my percentages were showing a bit wonky and my graph looked oddly similar, but not the same. It wasn't until I went back through the online zoom course and found a way to add a graph without adding an entire pivotchart.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. The summer time is the best time of year to launch a Theatre campaign.
2. December was not the best month to launch any campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. We had the highest number of successful outcomes when campaigns had a goal less than $5,000.
2. Campaigns with a goal higher than $4,000 were more likely to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

1. We had campaigns with no backers which gave us an error message when calculating average donations.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1. Other graphs we could create could be the amount of successful campaigns in another country and what time of year they were launched.
